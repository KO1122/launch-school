Encapsulation refers to the bundling of state (data) and behavior (operations) in an object.

4. In JavaScript, how does encapsulation differ from encapsulation in most other OO languages?

In most OO languages, encapsulation also involves hiding properties and methods of an object from other parts of an application. However, JS doesn't support access restrictions.
