# Practice Problems - Classes

1. Classes can be treated just like any other value in JS. This means that they can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments to other functions and returned from functions.
2. The `static` modifier makes the method into a static method. We would call the `manufacturer` method like this `Television.manufacturer()`.
