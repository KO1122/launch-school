# Practice Problems: Implicit and Explicit Function Execution Contexts

1. The code will output the global object.
2. The code will output obj. The difference between this output and that of problem 1 is that problem 1 uses the function execution context while this one uses the method execution context.
3. It will output 'Hello from the global scope!' and then 'Hello from the function scope!'.
4. call and apply methods
5. It will return 3.
